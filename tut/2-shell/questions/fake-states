If we let the user choose the initial state for a GPIO pin, they might not set the function properly, 
which would cause undefined/unexpected behavior of the pin. For example, if someone tries to use 
a pin as an output and only uses the set() and clear() functions, the pin will not be setup as 
an output and the code will not function as the user expects. By forcing the user to transition
the pin from the uninitialized state, it enforces the proper function selection before 
using the pin.
