StackVec requires clone for pop because the pop function is implmemented using a mutable reference to self,
so that calling pop does not consume the the entire StackVec. Because of this, we cannot return an Option<T>,
as that would move underlying data outside of the mutable reference, which the borrow checker disallows. 
Thus, by cloning the underlying data and returning it, we can avoid violating the Rust's borrowing rules.
