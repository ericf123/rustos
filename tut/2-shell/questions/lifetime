This bound is required because the backing buffer for the StackVec must live at least as long as the 
StackVec itself. If the StackVec lived longer than it's backing data struture, it could cause memory problems
if the backing structure is dropped before the StackVec is and you try to use the StackVec because the 
StackVec will no longer have the data it needs to operate.
