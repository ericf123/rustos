XMODEM is harder to test than sending raw data, because XMODEM is an interactive protocol, meaning the 
receiver and the sender have to work together in order to transmit packets of data and reconstruct the
original message. In order to test this, we would have to spin up an XMODEM receiver that is bound to 
some socket, while sending data in the raw does not have this restriction because we can just passively
take the output of the original command and compare it to the input.
