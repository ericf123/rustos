StackVec::push() can fail because StackVec is backed by a pre-allocated buffer that is not resizable.
Vec, on the other hand is backed by a heap-allocated data structure, and the Vec implementation handles
resizing of the backing buffer on demand, which makes it so that Vec::push() doesn't fail (except possibly in the case of OOM).
