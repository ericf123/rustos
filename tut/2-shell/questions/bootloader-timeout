The sender would stall indefinitely if the receiver sends the NAK packet indicating ready to receive before
the sender is up. Since the bootloader begins almost immediately when the Pi boots, if we don't synchronize
the Pi's boot and the transmission of the main kernel, the initial NAK could get lost and cause the sender
to be in the waiting state indefinitely. Using a small timeout and an infinite loop helps us avoid this
problem because we just keep retrying the reception until the sender is ready to send us data.
