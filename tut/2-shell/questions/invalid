structop knows to reject invalid values based on the type of the struct field that it is trying to 
parse the flag into. For example, the -f flag is mapped to a struct field with the serial::core::FlowControl
type, which is an Enum with three values (FlowNone, FlowSoftware, FlowHardware). It's not possible to coerce
the string value of "idk" to one of these three enum variants, so structop knows to reject this input.
