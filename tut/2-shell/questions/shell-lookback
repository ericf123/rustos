The shell uses StackVec to store the parsed argument vector from the command line.
It uses Console to read and write data, which in turn uses the MiniUart implementation to communicate
with the Raspberry Pi over serial. The MiniUart driver makes use of our GPIO driver under the hood 
to setup GPIO pins 14 and 15 for UART using alt function 5. MiniUart also uses the timer driver to 
set read timeouts. 
All of these drivers make use of the Volatile structs to wrap the underlying MMIO registers in a safe
API.
