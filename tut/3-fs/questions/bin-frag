I could improve the fragmentation by joining blocks with adjacent free blocks when they are freed. This
would make it so that blocks in the free bins are as large as they can be, reducing internal fragmentation.
Further, I could reduce fragmentation even more by selectively allocating memory from the global free pool
that is exactly the correct size for the request when the difference between the size of the block it is taking
from the free list is significantly large.
