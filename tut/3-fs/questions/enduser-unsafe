Exposing only safe APIs lets increases the amount of safe code that we have overall, and makes sure
that users consume our API in a safe way. This lets us guarantee that our code will not have memory 
safety bugs, provided that the unsafe parts of our code (which should be very small) work correctly. 
We can't provide similar guarantees in a language like C because consumers of our API could still do 
unsafe operations and create memory safety issues that way.
