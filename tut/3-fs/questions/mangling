Rust mangles names because it has namespaces that allow you to have two identifiers with the same name 
as long as they are inside different namespaces. Mangling transforms these identifiers into unique ones
based on information about the namespace they occupy. Since other languages, like C, do not have namespaces,
this does not cause an issue for those languages and they do not have to mangle the name. For example, 
if Rust didn't name mangle, methods in core::str and std::str would conflict with each other, which would
cause problems because they might have different implementations with the same name.
