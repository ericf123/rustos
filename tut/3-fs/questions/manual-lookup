To manually find /a/b/c.txt, first you would look at the byte at offset 44, which gives the cluster address
of the root directory, which is often 2. You would then traverse the root directory cluster chain's directory
entries, looking for a file with the name "b", which is marked as a directory (indicated by value 0x10 at
byte offset 11 in the directory entry). You would then concatenate the two bytes starting at offset 20 with the
two bytes starting at offset 26 to get the starting cluster address for the "b" directory. Once at that cluster,
we would repeat the process of scanning the directory's cluster chain for an entry with the name "a" and file
extension "txt", by looking at the first 11 bytes of the directory entries. "c.txt" then has a starting cluster 
address whose value is then calculated by concatenating the two bytes starting at offset 20 with the
two bytes starting at offset 26.
