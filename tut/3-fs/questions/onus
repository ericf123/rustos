Rust's strategy is advantageous for the caller because they can specify their desired memory alignment,
and it is guaranteed to be correctly aligned, which is not the case with malloc. Rust's strategy 
is also advantageous for the allocator because it means you can get away with not storing any information
in allocated chunks because the caller must provide a layout, which includes the allocated chunk's size,
in the dealloc request.
