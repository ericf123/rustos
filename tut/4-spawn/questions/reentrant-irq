You might want to nest I/O bound interrupt handlers, because the interrupt service routine could be slow,
and you want to be able to interrupt it for other interrupts that are very fast to handle (computation bound).

Doing this without first acknowledging pending IRQs would not necessarily cause an exception loop as there is 
eventually an ISR that masks interrupts. This would likely have to be the ISR that handles interrupts that 
are fast to handle, which then would handle all of the pending IRQs that are relatively fast, and eventually
get to the slower to handle IRQ.
