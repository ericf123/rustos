Separating the wait queue from the ready queue is advantageous because we could design waiting processes such
that they get moved to ready when their event occurs (e.g. by executing a syscall as soon as their event occurs).
This would probably result in lower latency and better throughput for tasks in the ready queue because we can 
avoid polling the tasks that are in the waiting state, which wastes time in the scheduler.
