We could lazily allocate Stack space by assigning allocating virtual memory for the stack space, but not 
assigning this virtual memory a backing physical frame. This way, no physical resources are used until the 
process needs to use its stack. It will simply page fault as soon as it needs to use the stack, at which point
the kernel can allocate a physical frame to back the process's virtual memory, and the process can continue 
executing normally.
