To lazily load the simd/fp registers, we could simply attempt to read/write to one of these registers in the 
context save subroutine in order to cause an exception if they are disabled. Then, we make a special exception 
handler that saves these registers. We wouldn't really have to modify the TrapFrame struct necessarily,
but it would have some wasted space if the registers weren't used (though we would not waste time saving 
the registers).
