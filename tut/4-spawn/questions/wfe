This is correct behavior because when all processes in the queue are waiting, then we must wait for SEV to
be called on some core, or for the event register to get set some other way. This is correct because it will 
resume the scheduler when the event occurs, and if the queue is actually empty, no event will ever occur,
so there is no reason to waste power.
