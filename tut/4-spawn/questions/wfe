This is not the correct behavior and causes the scheduler never to resume, because SEV is never called. This 
has to be changed to wfi for it work because otherwise the scheduler never gets woken up to call the Waiting 
poll function, and never schedules another process. For wfe to work, we would need a different core to call SEV
at some point when a process is done waiting.
