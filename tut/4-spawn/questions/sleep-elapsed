The elapsed time will differ from the requested time if the requested time does not align with
the process's time slice. This is because the process can only be woken back up when the scheduler
polls its ready function, and it will only do this when the process is about to be scheduled. The value 
will be identical if the sleep time is done exactly at the same time as the scheduler is trying to schedule 
the process. 

Most of the time, the requested time will not be identical to the actual time. The probability that the 
two times match is a function of the number of processes in the queue and the time quantum, as the time quantum
of the scheduler and the number of processes in the queue increase, the probability that the requested time will
match the actual time will decrease.
