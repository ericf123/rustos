Yes, processes have to trust the kernel. They need to trust that the kernel will service their system calls 
correctly, for example. Even more, they need to trust that the kernel will schedule them appropriately, theoretically
the kernel could just decide never to schedule a process, or the process could not get scheduled because of 
a poor scheduler design, for example the convoy effect with a FCFS scheduler.
